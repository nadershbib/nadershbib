<h1>About me</h1>
<p> Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I am a certified Front End Developer from CodeXAcademy who's highly passionate about developing web applications and learning new technologies. 
Throughout my journey I have been learning many different web technologies and integrating them into my projects, and It fascinates me seeing
how all these technologies and tools interact with each other.

<h1>Projects Overview </h1>

<a href="https://github.com/nadershbib/weather-app">Weather App</a>
<p>At the time I was learning about API requests I thought that it was a great idea to create a weather app to apply what I have been learning.
   In this application I am fethcing live weather data from the free public OpenWeatherMap API, integrating Autocomplete Cities functionality
   in the input using Google API, and I managed to display weather icons dynamically depending on the actual city temperature.
